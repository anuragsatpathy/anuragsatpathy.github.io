Welcome to Webpage!

I, Dr. Anurag Satpathy, am currently working as a Post Doctoral Fellow under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/sdas/"> Dr. Sajal K. Das</a> at the Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T), Rolla, Missouri, USA.

Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. in February 2023 from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India, under the supervision of <a href="https://website.nitrkl.ac.in/FProfile.aspx?e=sahoom"> Dr. Manmath Narayan Sahoo </a>.
My thesis, "Efficient Re-Embedding Strategies for Virtual Data Centers over Multi-Domain Substrate Networks," focused on developing effective resource management schemes to deal with fluctuating resource demands of virtual networks.


## Research Interests
My interests lie in various domains of computer systems including **cloud computing**, **network and server virtualization**, and **resource management for virtualized systems**. Recently, my interest has also piqued in the area of **serverless computing**, specifically on the issue of **cold start latency**. I have also taken an active interest in developing effective **computation offloading strategies** for **resource-constrained devices**, catering to **latency-sensitive IoT applications** over edge/fog systems.
