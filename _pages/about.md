Welcome to my Webpage!

I, Anurag Satpathy, work as a Post Doctoral Fellow under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/sdas/"> Dr. Sajal K. Das</a> at the Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T), Rolla, Missouri, USA.

Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. in February 2023 from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India, under the supervision of <a href="https://website.nitrkl.ac.in/FProfile.aspx?e=sahoom"> Dr. Manmath Narayan Sahoo </a>. My thesis, "Efficient Re-Embedding Strategies for Virtual Data Centers over Multi-Domain Substrate Networks," focused on developing effective resource management schemes to deal with fluctuating resource demands of virtual networks.


## Research Interests
My current reserach interest includes, **behavior-aware and equitable decision-making for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) under uncertainty**. I develop optimization and game-theoretic frameworks that integrate human behavior, fairness, and real-time constraints into cyber-physical systems (CPS). The focus is on algorithms for socially equitable decision-making in large-scale CPS under uncertainty, with applications to electric-vehicle charging, emergency evacuation, UAV-enabled medical logistics, and resource-constrained mobility systems. My long-term goal is to integrate learning-based and data-driven methods into CPS to model human behavior, adapt decision policies, and support socially equitable decision-making under uncertainty.
