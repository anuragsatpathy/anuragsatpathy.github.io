Welcome to Webpage !

I, Dr. Anurag Satpathy, is currently working as a Post-Doctoral Fellow under the supervison of <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/sdas/"> Dr. Sajal K. Das</a>.

completed my Ph.D. in February 2023 from the department of Computer Science and Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India. After completing my Ph.D., I have relocated to the US and am actively looking for post-doctoral positions.
Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Birla Institue of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, India, in 2017.
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from International Institute of Information Technology in Bhubaneswar, India, in 2014.


## Research Interests
My interests lie in various domains of computer systems including **cloud computing**, **network and server virtualization**, and **resource management for virtualized systems**. Recently, my interest has also piqued in the area of **serverless computing**, specifically on the issue of **cold start latency**. I have also taken an active interest in developing effective **computation offloading strategies** for **resource-constrained devices**, catering to **latency-sensitive IoT applications** over edge/fog systems.
