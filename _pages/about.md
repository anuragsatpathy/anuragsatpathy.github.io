## About Me

I am a research scholar in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India. I completed my master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Birla Institue of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, India, in 2017.
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the International Institute of Information Technology in Bhubaneswar, India, in 2014.


## Research Interests
My interests lie in various domains of computer systems including cloud computing, network and server virtualization, and resource management for virtualized systems. Recently, my interest has also piqued in the area of \textbf{serverless computing}, specifically on the issue of cold start latency. I have also taken an active interest in developing effective computation offloading strategies for resource-constrained devices, catering to latency-sensitive IoT applications over edge/fog systems.
