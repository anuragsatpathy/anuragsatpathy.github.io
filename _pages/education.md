## Research Experience
**2017 - Present**<br>
Ph.D. Research Scholar at National Institute of Technology Rourkela, Odisha, India under the supervision of <a href="https://website.nitrkl.ac.in/FProfile.aspx?e=sahoom"> Prof. Manmath Narayan Sahoo</a><br>

*Research Contributions:* Worked on the issue of resource managementâ€“ specifically, the focus was to develop efficient complete/selective re-embedding strategies for already embedded dynamic virtual data center requests experiencing demand fluctuations. <br>

*Relevant Publications:*

</li>
</ul>

**May 2016 - April 2017**<br>
Visiting Researcher at National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.vssut.ac.in/vice-chancellor-s-message.php"> Dr. Banshidhar Majhi </a> and <a href="https://cse.nitk.ac.in/faculty/sourav-kanti-addya"> Dr. Sourav Kanti Addya </a>

*Research Contribution:* Worked on solving the virtual machine placement problem and developed an efficient strategy to solve the VMP problem using a meta-heuristic crow-search algorithm. Different live-migration techniques were also integrated with the placement model, and its comparative behavior was studied. <br>

*Relevant Publication:* 
<ul>
<li> <a href ="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.12.032"> Crow search based virtual machine placement strategy in cloud data centers with live migration </a>
</li>
</ul>

**Dec 2013 - May 2014**<br>
Research Intern at the <a href="https://odisha.nic.in"> National Informatics Center Bhubaneswar </a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/c-r-kanungo-a9126038/?originalSubdomain=in">Mr. C.R. Kanungo </a> <br>

*Project Details:* Worked on the various routing protocols using cisco-certified simulation tools. Setting up an entire network and router configuration and coming up with conclusions to suggest the routing protocols to be opted for depending on the network latency and traffic, respectively, for a particular setup scenario.
