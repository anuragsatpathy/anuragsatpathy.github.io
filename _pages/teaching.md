## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy emphasizes **learning by doing**, **conceptual clarity**, and **research-driven problem solving**. I strive to connect theoretical foundations with real-world systems by incorporating **hands-on labs**, **case studies**, and **open-ended projects** drawn from cloud computing, distributed systems, and edge computing.

Through mentoring and laboratory instruction, I focus on:
- Developing strong algorithmic and systems intuition  
- Encouraging independent thinking and experimentation  
- Guiding students toward research-oriented problem formulation

## Teaching Interests

I am interested in teaching and developing courses in the following areas:

- Operating Systems  
- Data Structures and Algorithms  
- Distributed Systems  
- Cloud and Edge Computing  
- Serverless Computing  
- Optimization and Game Theory for Systems  
- Networked and Cyber-Physical Systems
