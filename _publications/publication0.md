## Abstract
Network virtualization (NV) allows the service providers (SPs) to partition the substrate resources in the form of isolated virtual networks (VNs) comprising multiple correlated virtual machines (VMs) and virtual links (VLs), capturing the dependencies. Though NV brought about multiple benefits, such as service isolation, improved quality-of-service (QoS), secure communication, and better utilization of substrate resources, it also introduced numerous research challenges. In this regard, one of the predominant challenges is assigning resources to the virtual components, i.e., VMs and VLs, also termed virtual network embedding (VNE). VNE comprises two closely related sub-problems, (i.) VM embedding and (ii.) VL embedding, and both the problems have been demonstrated to be NP-Hard. In the context of VNE, maximizing the revenue-to-cost ratio remains the focal point for the SPs as it not only boosts acceptance of VNRs but also effectively utilizes the substrate resources. However, the existing literature on VNE suffers from the following pitfalls: (i.) they only consider system resources or (ii.) limited topological attributes. However, both attributes are quintessential in accurately capturing the VNRs and the substrate network dependencies, thereby augmenting the revenue to cost ratio. This paper proposes an efficient VNE strategy called, NOde Ranking-based efficient virtual network embedding over single Domain substrate networks (NORD), to maximize the revenue to cost ratio. To address the problem of VM embedding, NORD utilizes a hybrid entropy and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) based ranking strategy for VMs and servers considering both system and topological attributes that effectively capture the dependencies. Once the ranking is generated, A greedy VM embedding followed by shortest path VL embedding completes the assignment. Simulation results confirm that NORD attains a 40% and 61% increment in average acceptance and revenue-to-cost ratios compared to the baselines.
