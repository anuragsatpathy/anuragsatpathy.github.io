## Abstract
Fog computing is a promising technology for critical, resource-intensive, and time-sensitive applications.
In this regard, a significant challenge is generating an offloading solution that minimizes the latency, energy, and number of outages for a dense IoT-Fog environment. However, the existing solutions either focus on a single objective or mainly dedicate fixed-sized resources as virtual resource units (VRUs). Moreover, these solutions are restrictive and not comprehensive, resulting in poor performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a VMAP model addressing the lacunas above. Offloading problem is abstracted as a one-to-many matching game between two sets of entities - tasks and fog nodes (FNs) by considering both preferences. Moreover, the preferences and weights of the parameters are generated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Exhaustive simulations indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms the baseline algorithms, considering average task latency and energy consumption by 35\% and 22.2%, respectively. Additionally, resource utilization also experiences a boost by 28.57%, and 97.98% of tasks complete their execution within the deadlines.
