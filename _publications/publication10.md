## Abstract
This chapter discusses the evolution of cloud networks starting from the traditional virtual machine (VM) based offerings to a more complex model that involves a fruitful interplay between the stratums. It describes the strengths and weaknesses of each solution and highlights areas where open research can be conducted. The chapter deals with the evolution of traditional VM-based offering to virtual data centers and the challenges associated with it. It also discusses the need for fog computing and identifies the challenges associated with it. The chapter considers the challenges and applications of a more complicated cooperation between Internet of Things-Fog-Cloud. It elaborates the motivation behind such evolution and then discusses the roadblocks in the process. The chapter considers the pros and cons of the solution approaches and identifies areas where open research can be conducted.
