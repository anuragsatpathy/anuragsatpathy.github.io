## Abstract
Function-as-a-service (FaaS) has reduced the user burden by allowing cloud service providers (CSPs) to overtake operational activities such as resource allocation, service deployment, auto-scaling, and load-balancing, to name a few. The users are only responsible for developing the business logic through event-triggered functions catering to an application. Although FaaS brings about multiple benefits to the users, a typical challenge in this context is the time incurred in the environmental setup of the containers on which the functions execute, often referred to as the cold start time leading to delayed execution and quality-of-service (QoS) violations. This paper presents an efficient scheduling strategy FASE that takes advantage of a finite-sized warm pool to facilitate the instantaneous execution of functions on pre-warmed containers. Test-bed evaluations over AWS Lambda confirm that FIST achieves a 40% reduction in the average cold start time and 1.29x speedup compared to the baselines.
